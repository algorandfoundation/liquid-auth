# Overview

The vision of this project is to attest to services based on Algorand specific private keys.
It relates to [ARC-31](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/pull/160) and poses the question:

> Can we use FIDO2 to authenticate users to a blockchain?

This repository will serve as a reference implementation on the necessary endpoints to be
compliant with `WebAuthn` and `FIDO2`.
